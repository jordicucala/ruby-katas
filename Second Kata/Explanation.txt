1. Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value
2. Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.
3. Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.
4. Now, using the same array from #2, use the reject method to extract all even numbers into a new array.
5. We need to obtain the same result of the exercises 3 and 4 but now using map
6. Test the same exercises with the collect method. What result do you obtain?
7. What are the differences between each, map, collect and select? 
8. Take the following array 
a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.


9. If you execute the following sentence can you get  an error if the file doesn't exist. Use exceptions to print "File not found" if the file doesn't exist.

file = open("/unexistant_file")

10. Use retry to change the name of a file to another file. This file should exist in the project.
